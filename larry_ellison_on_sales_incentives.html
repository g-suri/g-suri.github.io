    <h2> Larry Ellison on Sales Incentives </h2>
    <p> 2020-07-26 </p>

I'm currently reading Softwar by Matthew Symonds after <a href = "https://twitter.com/collision"> John Collison </a> recommended it on the <a href = "http://investorfieldguide.com/collison/">Invest Like The Best</a> podcast. Softwar has some great segments on sales compensation, the perverse incentives comp plans can create, and the resulting impact on margins and profit. Below are some of my favorite quotes from Larry Ellison on this topic (emphasis mine).
</br>

<p>
"In any sales-driven organization, the way in which the "comp plan" is structured is a vital ingredient in determining success or failure. <b>The objective of a good comp plan is simply stated: it should be transparent and fair and encourage the achievement of carefully worked out "stretch" targets</b>; the salespeople who do most for the bottom line should be able to get rich themselves, while those who are hoping for a free ride should be penalized and cleared out. In other words, the best comp plans are simple to understand and work with the grain of human nature. When comp plans start delivering the opposite of what's intended, it's usually because they have become too clever by half."

<p>
  "It was like the goddam tax code. It created financial incentives for people to do what you wanted them to do. Unfortunately, like the tax code, <b>it was loaded with perverse incentives and people learned how to game the system and increase their profit bonuses.</b>"
</p>

<p>
  "If consulting claimed that a product bug had cost them extra unbillable time at a customer, Ray would give the consulting team "budget relief" and the team's bonuses would not be affected. It sounds reasonable, but <b>it created a perverse incentive to blame everything on product bugs.</b>"
</p>

<p>
  "Consulting managers were paid on the profit margin of the engagement they were working on. Ray had a system where his managers could spend money and not be charged for it. For example, when Ray wanted to encourage training he told his managers they didn't have to pay for the cost of training their people. Suddenly every sales meeting became a 'training' meeting. There were lots of ways to get expense relief."
</p>

<p>
  "Ray would experiment with different compensation ideas and sales force organizations every year. One of the worst ideas I can remember was when Ray decided we didn't do enough selling through partners. The sales force convinced him that the way to fix this was to pay more money to the sales force if the deal went through a partner than if the deal came directly to Oracle. For example, if you sold a million-dollar deal directly, Oracle would get a million dollars and you would get a $100,000 commission. But if you sold a million-dollar deal through a partner, Oracle would get $600,000 and you would get a $120,000 commission. Needless to say, our sales force pushed as many deals as they could through partners that year., so the partners were very happy. The sales force got higher commission payments for going through partners, so they were happy. <b>The only loser was Oracle Corporation. We ended up paying huge partner bonuses and larger sales commissions, so our sales margin went down.</b> The only possible justification for this extra pay for partner deals was if the partners started bringing in large numbers of deals on their own. But they didn't."
</p>
<p>
  "Our sales managers converted Ray to the fundamental belief that the best way to change the behavior of our sales force was to pay for it. So when Ray wanted to encourage better cooperation among our different sales groups, he decided to pay multiple groups on the same deal. We had industry sales teams, product sales teams, geographic sales teams, global sales managers, etc. All could get paid on the same deal. They wouldn't split a commission — no, no no — instead we'd pay double commissions, triple commissions, and so on. But Ray told me not to worry because we could afford to pay everybody on the same deal so long as we raised everybody's quota. I said, 'Ray, <b>paying people for things they don't sell is not a good idea.</b> Raising quotas is not a good idea.' So one of the very first things I did when I took over the sales comp plans was eliminate most double compensation deals. It allowed us to bring quotas down drastically. And it smoked out the people who were making a living getting paid on other people's deals."</p>
